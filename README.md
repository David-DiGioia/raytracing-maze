# raytracing-maze
A 3d maze effect generated using a simple form of raytracing. The idea for this was inspired by The Coding Train's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYgIKn7iDH8&t=1085s, although his was implemented in Javascript and p5.js, but mine is implemented from scratch in C++. The Windows code is modified from Casey Muratori's Handmade Hero series, I recommend watching it: https://www.youtube.com/user/handmadeheroarchive/featured
